This is a list of possible use cases for the openwebindex which had been collected
during a brainstorming at the meeting on 10.2.2015.
This list may neither be complete nor correct and is not a finalized to-do. It is
just a collection of ideas.
This list is here to document the possible framework for requirements of the API.
The API must provide options and values to make these use cases possible.

Use Cases:
- support different display formats and formatting in the search result
- do a web archiving
- do a monitoring (of domains/hosts or the openwebindex Backbone?)
- provide a tool to do documentation (unclear what that means)
- predictive analytics?
- provide a link graph / backlinks
- quantitive analysis
- provide large data sets about analytics and other lists (backlinks etc)
- provide a payment option for large-data services
- provide a browser for content in the web
- linguistic analyses
- trend analyses

Remember: this list are not ideas and suggestions for the API, it is a list of
suggestions and ideas for the search portal which is NOT part of #openwebindex.
