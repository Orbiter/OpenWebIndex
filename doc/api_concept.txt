The following had been fixed in the meeting from 09.02.2015:

A1: The API is open
The api must accept requests from all users without any authentication.
No authorization is required. The access is open to everyone.
This has an exception if the request frequence is too high.
For high-volume users, there will be a payment option for mass retrieval
which then actually requires an account and authorization at the api.

A2: The API provides privacy
The api software should not store and/or log any IP addresses permanently.
However, to detect mass retrieval and to protect itself it is necessary to
store IP addresses temporary in RAM. 

A3: Retrieval Functions
The api provides information retrieval functions to search the document
(web etc.).
The api may also provide inside information about link structure
and crawl success details.

A4: Contribution Functions
The api should provide push functions to enable users to insert information.
Pushed information can be on document basis (which requires either
authentication or fraud detection or both) or on host-bases (which could
start a web crawl based on the history of crawls of the domain and domain size)

A5: Maintenance Functions
The api should provide a function to announce non-existent document.
This may cause that the document is deleted from the index if it actually
does not exist any more as document in the web. This requires fraud detection
to protect the function to be mis-used as censoring tool.

A6: Historisation and cache access
The api should provide access to cached document including different versions
of the document in the past.
